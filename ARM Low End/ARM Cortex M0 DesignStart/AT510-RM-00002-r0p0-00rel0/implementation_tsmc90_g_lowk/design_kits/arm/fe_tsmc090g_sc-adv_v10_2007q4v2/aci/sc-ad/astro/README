Astro Routing Options
=====================

You must execute the following commands in Astro in order to support
fat metal spacing rules.

  At the Astro command line:
  ---------------------------
  axgSetRouteOptions
  setFormField "Route Common Options" "Fat Wire Checking" "merge then check"
  setFormField "Route Common Options" "Merge Fat Wire On" "signal routing too"
  formOK "Route Common Options"

  OR within the Astro GUI:
  -------------------------
  Route->Route Common Options
    On the form, look for "Fat Wire Checking" and click on 
    "merge then check". Look also for "Merge Fat Wire On" and click on
    "signal routing too".

Astro may not implement the M1.S.2 rule properly. Furthermore, the
Astro internal DRC may not recognize these violations.

Notch and Gap filling is not adviced for this library because they create
fat metal spacing violations. The Notches and Gaps should be fixed at the
time of detail routing.
  
  At the Astro command line:
  ---------------------------
  axgSetRouteOptions
  setFormField "Route Common Options" "Same Net Notch" "check and fix"
  formOK "Route Common Options"

  OR within the Astro GUI:
  -------------------------
  Route->Route Common Options
    On the form, look for "Same Net Notch" and click on 
    "check and fix"
