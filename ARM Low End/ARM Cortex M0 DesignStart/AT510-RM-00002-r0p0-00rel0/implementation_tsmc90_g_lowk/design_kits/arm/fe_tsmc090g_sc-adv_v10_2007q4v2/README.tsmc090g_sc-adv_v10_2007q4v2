Methodology
-----------
This section describes design flow issues that may be applicable to this
release.

  o Synopsys/Primetime/Pearl
        - Please note that SDF generated with tool versions above
          also require post-processing prior to back-annotation.
          The following post-processing scripts are available:
             
              - Synopsys Primetime
                aci/sc-ad/primetime/pt_postprocessor.pl             
        - Please note that SDF generated with versions other than
          those specified above may not annotate properly due to
          various changes in the SDF output format.
	  
  o The FILL2AD cell has to be used to prevent latch-up violations at
    chip level. Place the FILL2AD cell during standard cell
    placement to meet process rules for taps.
    
  o The FILL1AD cell is intended to be used during place & route for the purpose of
    continuing the metal1 rails, nwell, and any other layers needed to complete a
    row in the event that two cells are unable to neighbor each other by abutment.

    Due to the small geometries needed in the FILL1AD cell, some rules may fail on
    this cell when DRC is run on FILL1AD in isolation. All DRC errors will disappear
    when the cell is abutted next to another cell, as in a real design.

     NW.A.1, Area >= 1.55
     
  o All cells will have LVS violations when LVS is run on the cells in	   	 
    isolation because there is no direct well connection. This error	   	 
    will disappear when the FILL2AD is used as well-tie cell. Well	   	 
    text in gds2 has been used in verification.    
	
      - The TIEHIAD and TIELOAD cells may produce a PATHCHK ERC error in lvs
        because the gate of the transistors doesn't have path to power/ground.

      - The following cells will have ERC violations when LVS is run
        at the cell level because there is no power/ground path to
        the gates. All ERC errors will disappear when another cell is driving
        these cells as in a real design.

           MXI2DXLAD MXI2DX1AD MXI2DX2AD MXI2DX4AD MXI2DX8AD

      - The following cells will have ERC violations when you run LVS
        because the gate of the transistors doesn't have path to power/ground.
        The user has to add these cells manually into the design netlist to
        pass the LVS as these cells have devices in them.

        FILLCAP3AD   FILLCAP4AD   FILLCAP8AD   FILLCAP16AD   
	FILLCAP32AD  FILLCAP64AD

Impact on Designs Using 2006q3v1
---------------------------------
This section describes the impact of this release on current designs
which are using the previous release.

*** This is a mandatory update. ***

ARM Update Recommendation:

  o Install version 2007q1v1.
    Discontinue using previous versions.
    
This package contains no timing models. The timing models for
this library are in separate *.tgz files whose name starts
with "ft" and has an identical process, library and release
name as the name of this tgz file. 
        
Impact of this Release on Major Library Components:

  o GDS2 has not changed.
  o LEF macro views have not changed.
  o Astro FRAM views have changed:
    - Pin directions added to the Milkyway database.
    - No change to physical footprints.      
  o LVS netlists have not changed
  o LEF technology files have not changed.
  o Astro technology files have not changed.
  o Milkyway database has not changed.  
  o Synopsys Timing views have not changed
     - Timing views of 0.8V domain added to this release.
       Seperate *.tgz files whose name starts with "ft" and 
       has an identical process, library and release
       name as the name of this tgz file. 
  o Symbol views have not changed.
  o Verilog model views have not changed.
  o Vhdl model views have not changed.
  o .plib and .pdb views have been changed:
     - To update metal Pin directions and add "cap_per_sq"
     
  o The process of updating our product development infrastructure to
    change our new corporate name from "Artisan Components, Inc." and
    "ARM Physical IP, Inc." to "ARM, Inc." is in progress. This product
    release reflects this change. You may still find instances of the company
    name "Artisan Components, Inc.", "Artisan", or "ARM Physical IP" in the
    released product files. This is not an error but is an artifact of the
    logistical difficulties in updating all aspects of our product development
    infrastructure simultaneously. Note that the Artisan brand name remains a
    legitimate product description and continues to be used where appropriate.

Methodology
-----------
This section describes design flow issues that may be applicable to this
release.

  o Synopsys/Primetime/Pearl
        - Please note that SDF generated with tool versions above
          also require post-processing prior to back-annotation.
          The following post-processing scripts are available:
             
              - Synopsys Primetime
                aci/sc-ad/primetime/pt_postprocessor.pl             
        - Please note that SDF generated with versions other than
          those specified above may not annotate properly due to
          various changes in the SDF output format.
	  
  o The FILL2AD cell has to be used to prevent latch-up violations at
    chip level. Place the FILL2AD cell during standard cell
    placement to meet process rules for taps.
    
  o The FILL1AD cell is intended to be used during place & route for the purpose of
    continuing the metal1 rails, nwell, and any other layers needed to complete a
    row in the event that two cells are unable to neighbor each other by abutment.

    Due to the small geometries needed in the FILL1AD cell, some rules may fail on
    this cell when DRC is run on FILL1AD in isolation. All DRC errors will disappear
    when the cell is abutted next to another cell, as in a real design.

     NW.A.1, Area >= 1.55
     
  o All cells will have LVS violations when LVS is run on the cells in	   	 
    isolation because there is no direct well connection. This error	   	 
    will disappear when the FILL2AD is used as well-tie cell. Well	   	 
    text in gds2 has been used in verification.    
	
      - The TIEHIAD and TIELOAD cells may produce a PATHCHK ERC error in lvs
        because the gate of the transistors doesn't have path to power/ground.

      - The following cells will have ERC violations when LVS is run
        at the cell level because there is no power/ground path to
        the gates. All ERC errors will disappear when another cell is driving
        these cells as in a real design.

           MXI2DXLAD MXI2DX1AD MXI2DX2AD MXI2DX4AD MXI2DX8AD

      - The following cells will have ERC violations when you run LVS
        because the gate of the transistors doesn't have path to power/ground.
        The user has to add these cells manually into the design netlist to
        pass the LVS as these cells have devices in them.

    will disappear when the FILL2AD is used as well-tie cell. Well	   	 
    text in gds2 has been used in verification.    
	
      - The TIEHIAD and TIELOAD cells may produce a PATHCHK ERC error in lvs
        because the gate of the transistors doesn't have path to power/ground.

      - The following cells will have ERC violations when LVS is run
        at the cell level because there is no power/ground path to
        the gates. All ERC errors will disappear when another cell is driving
        these cells as in a real design.

      - The following cells will have ERC violations when you run LVS
        because the gate of the transistors doesn't have path to power/ground.
        The user has to add these cells manually into the design netlist to
        pass the LVS as these cells have devices in them.

Technology Implementation
-------------------------
This section provides information on items that may not be included in the
foundry documentation.

  Characterization Corners:

        - Characterized library using the following conditions:
	   scadv_tsmc_cln90g_rvt_ff_1p1v_0c   P/V/T = FF/1.1V/0C
 	   scadv_tsmc_cln90g_rvt_ff_1p1v_125c P/V/T = FF/1.1V/125C
 	   scadv_tsmc_cln90g_rvt_ff_1p1v_m40c P/V/T = FF/1.1V/-40C
	   scadv_tsmc_cln90g_rvt_tt_1p0v_50c  P/V/T = TT/1.0V/50C
	   scadv_tsmc_cln90g_rvt_tt_1p0v_25c  P/V/T = TT/1.0V/25C
     	   scadv_tsmc_cln90g_rvt_ss_0p9v_125c P/V/T = SS/0.9V/125C

  Mandatory Tapeout layers required for foundry:

      - GDS2 text layer 63:63 is allocated by the foundry for IP marking.
        *** This is a mandatory tapeout layer ****
	
Methodology
-----------
This section describes design flow issues that may be applicable to this
release.

  o Synopsys/Primetime/Pearl
        - Please note that SDF generated with tool versions above
          also require post-processing prior to back-annotation.
          The following post-processing scripts are available:
             
              - Synopsys Primetime
                aci/sc-ad/primetime/pt_postprocessor.pl             
        - Please note that SDF generated with versions other than
          those specified above may not annotate properly due to
          various changes in the SDF output format.
	  
  o The FILL2AD cell has to be used to prevent latch-up violations at
    chip level. Place the FILL2AD cell during standard cell
    placement to meet process rules for taps.
    
  o The FILL1AD cell is intended to be used during place & route for the purpose of
    continuing the metal1 rails, nwell, and any other layers needed to complete a
    row in the event that two cells are unable to neighbor each other by abutment.

    Due to the small geometries needed in the FILL1AD cell, some rules may fail on
    this cell when DRC is run on FILL1AD in isolation. All DRC errors will disappear
    when the cell is abutted next to another cell, as in a real design.

     NW.A.1, Area >= 1.55
     
  o All cells will have LVS violations when LVS is run on the cells in	   	 
    isolation because there is no direct well connection. This error	   	 
    will disappear when the FILL2AD is used as well-tie cell. Well	   	 
    text in gds2 has been used in verification.    
	
      - The TIEHIAD and TIELOAD cells may produce a PATHCHK ERC error in lvs
        because the gate of the transistors doesn't have path to power/ground.

      - The following cells will have ERC violations when LVS is run
        at the cell level because there is no power/ground path to
        the gates. All ERC errors will disappear when another cell is driving
        these cells as in a real design.

           MXI2DXLAD MXI2DX1AD MXI2DX2AD MXI2DX4AD MXI2DX8AD

      - The following cells will have ERC violations when you run LVS
        because the gate of the transistors doesn't have path to power/ground.
        The user has to add these cells manually into the design netlist to
        pass the LVS as these cells have devices in them.
