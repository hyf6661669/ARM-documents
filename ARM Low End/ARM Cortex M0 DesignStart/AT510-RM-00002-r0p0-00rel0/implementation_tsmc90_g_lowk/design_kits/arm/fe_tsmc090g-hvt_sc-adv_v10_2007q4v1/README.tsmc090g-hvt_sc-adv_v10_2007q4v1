This section provides information on items that may not be included in the
foundry documentation.

  Characterization Corners:
  Note: This package contains no timing models. The timing models for
        this library are in separate *.tgz files whose name starts
        with "ft" and has an identical process, library and release
        name as the name of this tgz file.

  Mandatory Tapeout layers required for foundry:

      - GDS2 text layer 63:63 is allocated by the foundry for IP marking.
        *** This is a mandatory tapeout layer ****
	
Methodology
-----------
This section describes design flow issues that may be applicable to this
release.

  o Synopsys/Primetime/Pearl
        - Please note that SDF generated with tool versions above
          also require post-processing prior to back-annotation.
          The following post-processing scripts are available:
             
              - Synopsys Primetime
                aci/sc-ad/primetime/pt_postprocessor.pl             
        - Please note that SDF generated with versions other than
          those specified above may not annotate properly due to
          various changes in the SDF output format.
	  
  o The FILL2ADTH cell has to be used to prevent latch-up violations at
    chip level. Place the FILL2ADTH cell during standard cell
    placement to meet process rules for taps.
    
  o The FILL1ADTH cell is intended to be used during place & route for the purpose of
    continuing the metal1 rails, nwell, and any other layers needed to complete a
    row in the event that two cells are unable to neighbor each other by abutment.

    Due to the small geometries needed in the FILL1ADTH cell, some rules may fail on
    this cell when DRC is run on FILL1ADTH in isolation. All DRC errors will disappear
    when the cell is abutted next to another cell, as in a real design.

     NW.A.1, Area >= 1.55
     
  o All cells will have LVS violations when LVS is run on the cells in	   	 
    isolation because there is no direct well connection. This error	   	 
    will disappear when the FILL2ADTH is used as well-tie cell. Well	   	 
    text in gds2 has been used in verification.    
	
      - The TIEHIADTH and TIELOADTH cells may produce a PATHCHK ERC error in lvs
        because the gate of the transistors doesn't have path to power/ground.

      - The following cells will have ERC violations when LVS is run
        at the cell level because there is no power/ground path to
        the gates. All ERC errors will disappear when another cell is driving
        these cells as in a real design.

           MXI2DXLADTH MXI2DX1ADTH MXI2DX2ADTH MXI2DX4ADTH MXI2DX8AD

      - The following cells will have ERC violations when you run LVS
        because the gate of the transistors doesn't have path to power/ground.
        The user has to add these cells manually into the design netlist to
        pass the LVS as these cells have devices in them.

        FILLCAP3ADTH   FILLCAP4ADTH   FILLCAP8ADTH   FILLCAP16ADTH   
	FILLCAP32ADTH  FILLCAP64ADTH

  o All cells will have LVS violations when LVS is run on the cells in	   	 
    isolation because there is no direct well connection. This error	   	 
    will disappear when the FILL2ADTH is used as well-tie cell. Well	   	 
    text in gds2 has been used in verification.    
	
      - The TIEHIADTH and TIELOADTH cells may produce a PATHCHK ERC error in lvs
        because the gate of the transistors doesn't have path to power/ground.

      - The following cells will have ERC violations when LVS is run
        at the cell level because there is no power/ground path to
        the gates. All ERC errors will disappear when another cell is driving
        these cells as in a real design.

      - The following cells will have ERC violations when you run LVS
        because the gate of the transistors doesn't have path to power/ground.
        The user has to add these cells manually into the design netlist to
        pass the LVS as these cells have devices in them.
