Encounter Routing Issues
------------------------
NanoRoute may not implement the M1.S.2 rule properly. Furthermore,
the DRC command "verify geometry" may not recognize these violations. You can
eliminate some of the violations by using the following option in the Encounter
shell before detail route.

setNanoRouteMode drouteAllowMergedWireAtPin false

==============================================================================
FILLCAPs are function as FILL cells. Inside FILLCAP, there are PMOS and 
NMOS devices forming capacitors between VDD and VSS power rails. This helps
to reduce ground bounce in the power grid.
